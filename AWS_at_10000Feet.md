#### None of this will be on the exam.

"Invention requires two things: 
1. The ability to try a lot of experiments. 
2. Not having to live with the collateral damage of failed experiments.

# The 10,000 Foot Overview

## AWS Global Infrastructure
#### What is a Region? What is an Availabilty Zone?
* A Region is a geographical area. Each Region consists of 2 (or more) Availability Zones.
* An Availability Zone (AZ) is simply a Data Center. Always architect for failure by putting your resources in multiple AZs.
#### What is an Edge Location?
* Edge Locations are endpoints for AWS which are used for caching content. Typically this consists of CloudFront, Amazon's Content Delivery Network (CDN).
* There are more Edge Locations than Regions.

### EXAM TIPS
Understand the difference between a region, an Availability Zone (AZ) and an Edge Location.
* A Region is a physical location in the world which consists of two or more Availability Zones (AZs).
* An AZ is one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking and connectivity, housed in separate facilities.
* Edge Locations are endpoints for AWS which are used for caching content. Typically this consists of CloudFront, Amazon's Content Delivery Network (CDN).
