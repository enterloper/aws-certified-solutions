Standard Monitoring = 5 minutes
Detailed Monitoring = 1 minute

### What can be done with Cloudwatch?
* Dashboard - Creates awesome dashboards to see what is happening with your AWS environment.
* Alarms - Allows you to set Alarms that notify you when particular thresholds are hit.
* Events - CloudWatch Events help you to respond to state changes in your AWS resources.
* Logs - CloudWatch Logs help you to aggregate, monitor, and store logs.
* difference between CloudWatch and CloudTrail is that:
    * CloudWatch is for **logging**, and **monitoring** (like CPU utilization)
    * CloudTrail is for **auditing** which will monitor your AWS environment (watches to see if you created new users, new instances, changes etc...)
