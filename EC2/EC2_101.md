# EC2 101
### What is EC2 
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute 
capacity in the cloud. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server 
instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing
requirements change.
 
Basically, it's virtual machines in the cloud.

### The past
Before cloud computing if we needed a database in the server, you'd have to setup processes, RAM,
 disc sizes, SSD drives, et cetera. You then had to figure out what was equivalent to a "lease" 
 on the tangible servers. Then a team would rack the server, install any components/wiring, and 
 then the sysadmins would have to set everything else up.
 
When Cloud Competing initially hit the market it changed the way we create and architect 
solutions to our network problems. 

### The now
Amazon EC2 changes the ecnomomics of computing by allowing your to pay only for capacity that you
 actually use. Amazon EC2 provides developers the tools to build failure resilient applications 
 and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.
 
### EC2 Options
* On Demand Instance - allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no 
commitment. 
By the second for LINUX instances only, Windows instances are only by the hour, but will release 
by the end of 2018

* Reserved Instance - provide you with a capacity reservation, and offer a significant discount on 
the hourly charge for an instance. 1 year or 3 year cotract where you pay up front, the more you 
pay the bigger the discount. If you fully understand your application and know what to anticipate in regard to traffic this may be the most economical
 model.

* Spot - enable you to bid whatever price you want for your instance capacity, providing for even
 greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times. Spot rate will go up and
  down just like currency depending on supply and demand. You set a bid price for by the hour or 
  by the second, 

* Dedicated Hosts - Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts can help you 
reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses. Oracle and 
VMware when you need dedicated hosts. Also if a company or government entity want to avoid a 
multi-tenant scenario if the company is worried about security concerns for whatever reason, this
 may be a more enticing choice.
   
### On Demand
* Users that want the low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without any up-front payment or 
long-term commitment.
* Applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted.
* Applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time.

### Reserved
* Applications with predictable usage
* Applications that require reserved capacity
* Users/companies able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing costs even further
    * Standard Reserved Instances (Up to 75% off on demand)
    * Convertable Reserved Instances (Up to 54% off on demand) capability to change the 
    attributes of the RI as long as the exchange results in the creation of Reserved Instances of
     equal or greater value.
